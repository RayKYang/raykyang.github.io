<p>Imagine you are invited to a party. Probably you want to get noticed by other partygoers. Or at least you want to be recognized as a cool person by those who you are interested in and care about. The “coolness” will result in some social benefits you desire. This scene is about “social evaluation,” which applies to both individuals and firms. On the social evaluation stage, because there are peer actors (competitors) joining you, you want to stand out of the crowd to impress your audiences (customers and suppliers). If you succeed, the peers will admire you, the audiences will adore you, and of course, you can profit from winning the esteems and relationships. The question is, “how to position yourself to be ‘cool’ to win the game?”</p>
<p>Practically, the first question coming to your mind might be “to what extent should I be similar to or different from others?” You obviously want to be different so that you can stand out. But you don’t want to be too different as that people think you are wired. Your goal is to “impress” them but not to “surprise” them. The difference between the two is whether you meet their expectations. The audiences have expectations on your appearances and behaviors. It can take the form of a set of commonly accepted attributes and behaviors. Those are “norms.” Importantly, you will be penalized if you fail to meet people’s expectations.</p>
<p>Being different is risky. Especially when it leads to a failure in meeting audience expectations, you will lose their acceptance, which sociologists call “legitimacy”. Consequently, you lose access to valuable resources and opportunities. Now you get the headache — being similar can’t make you stand out but being different places you into the danger of losing legitimacy. A simple solution, not necessarily simplistic, is to find a middle point between the two extremes — “be as legitimately different as possible.” This is a “holistic” approach, in which you consider all the audiences, attributes, and evaluation processes as a “whole”. And you have a clear goal—maximizing the total audience perceptions. It is also implementable, isn’t it? It reminds me of Confucius’ &amp; Aristotle’s “Golden Mean.”</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can do some “analysis”.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Then, let’s move away from the “holistic” approach and do some analysis of the positioning problem. Specifically, let’s separate the whole problem in three ways: (1) separating the audiences, (2) separating the actor attributes, and (3) separating the evaluation processes. First, different audience groups (government, customers, investors, etc.) may demand different levels of conformity vs. differentiation, so you may want to deploy a strategy to target specific audiences. Second, as audiences allocate their decision weights among multiple dimensions of difference, you can conform on most of them and only differentiate on a couple of others (we care about the dress code but worry about the outfit clash). Third, as the audiences typically engage in a categorization process before making the final selection, you can strategize for “entering the final game” and “winning the final game” separately.</p>
<p>I’ll be glad if the post triggers your interest (I believe it deserves some more thoughts). As audiences evaluate actors’ objective attributes with their subjective minds, there are numerous factors determining how their opinions aggregate over time and emerge as market behavior. There could also be positive and negative feedback loops for the mutual influence between actor behavior and audience perceptions.</p>
