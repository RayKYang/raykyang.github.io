      <description>On March 6th, the R package “reticulate”(1.11.1) was released on Cran, which allows R users to directly call Python objects or use Python in an R interface.1 Bloggers have been praising this development for the ground-breaking interoperability between R and Python. With “reticulate,” we no longer need to jump between different IDEs to leverage the complementarity between R and Python. This will certainly bring big ease to the programming routine of many “bilingual” data scientist using both R and Python.</description>

      <description>Statistical Intuition The univariate mixed-effects model The multivariate mixed-effects model  An Implementation Example Initialization Estimation    I co-developed an R pakcage “MMeM” for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of random effects \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{e}\) on multiple dependent variables.
 
Statistical Intuition The univariate mixed-effects model In univariate mixed-effects model: \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Xb} + \mathbf{Zu} + \mathbf{e}\) (1), we estimate the variance component \(\sigma_u^2\) and \(\sigma_e^2\) for \(\mathbf{u} \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma_u^2\mathbf{I})\) and \(\mathbf{e} \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma_e^2\mathbf{I})\).</description>

      <description>Installation Examples compile the correlation table compile the regression table plot the moderating effect    Today, I released an R package “regrrr” on Cran. In strategy/management research, we always need to compile the regression results into the publishable format and sometimes plot the moderating effects. This package does the job.
Here is the quickstart guide.
 
Installation To install from CRAN:
install.packages(&amp;quot;regrrr&amp;quot;) library(regrrr) You can also use devtools to install the latest development version:</description>

      <description>In the past several years, I spent quite some time coaching college students in the business major on their individual/team projects. These include business model design (BUS146), strategic audit (BUS109), and marketing plan (BUS103). In each quarter, there are around 100 students enrolled in BUS103/BUS109, and 50 in BUS146. And they typically select different companies and different entrepreneurship ideas to work on.
At some point, I realized it is crucial for them to quickly “model” a business so they can have a very clear picture of how businesses work.</description>

      <description>I had a whim and wanted to do some quick bibliometric analysis on the topic of “strategic positioning”.
