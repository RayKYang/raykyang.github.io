<li><p>Specialization creates efficiency. <b>Integration increases wealth</b>. In modern societies, specialized “things” — physical objects created by specialized producers — result in the lack of integration among the divided things and thus leave money on the table. The total wealth in an economy lies in the efficiency boost from specialized producers, which ultimately need to bring their products together through market exchange mechanism <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>New combinations generate innovation. Innovation resides in the new linkages resulting from the new combinations of exiting things <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. In the digital age, <b>new connections between existing things create new data dimensions</b>, which leads to new opportunities for cost saving and value creation.</p></li>
<li><p>Right after new connections among existing things generate stabilized benefits for existing users and producers, the newly integrated system starts to form new sub-systems at higher-level complexities <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Again, <b>new cost-saving and value-creation opportunities will emerge from the higher-level connections among the lower-level subsystems</b>.</p></li>
