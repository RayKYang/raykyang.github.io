      <title>Interoperability in Tech. Evolution—Thoughts on “Reticulate&#34;</title>

      <description>Five days ago, the R package “reticulate”(1.11.1) was released on Cran, which allows us to directly call python objects in R1. Bloggers have been praising this ground-breaking development all the time for the enhanced interoperability between R and Python. Because with “reticulate,” we no longer need to jump between different IDEs in order to work on the same projects to leverage the complementarity between R and Python. This will certainly bring great change to the programming routine of many data scientists.</description>

      <description>Statistical Intuition The univariate mixed-effects model The multivariate mixed-effects model  An Implementation Example Initialization Estimation    I co-developed an R pakcage “MMeM” for estimating the variance-covariance matrix of random effects \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{e}\) on multiple dependent variables.
 
Statistical Intuition The univariate mixed-effects model In univariate mixed-effects model: \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Xb} + \mathbf{Zu} + \mathbf{e}\) (1), we estimate the variance component \(\sigma_u^2\) and \(\sigma_e^2\) for \(\mathbf{u} \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma_u^2\mathbf{I})\) and \(\mathbf{e} \sim N(\mathbf{0}, \sigma_e^2\mathbf{I})\).</description>

      <description>Installation Examples compile the correlation table compile the regression table plot the moderating effect    Today, I released an R package “regrrr” on Cran. In strategy/management research, we always need to compile the regression results into the publishable format and sometimes plot the moderating effects. This package does the job.
Here is the quickstart guide.
 
Installation To install from CRAN:
install.packages(&amp;quot;regrrr&amp;quot;) library(regrrr) You can also use devtools to install the latest development version:</description>

      <description>In the past several years, I spent quite some time coaching college students in the business major on their individual/team projects. These include business model design (BUS146), strategic audit (BUS109), and marketing plan (BUS103). In each quarter, there are around 100 students enrolled in BUS103/BUS109, and 50 in BUS146. And they typically select different companies and different entrepreneurship ideas to work on.
At some point, I realized it is crucial for them to quickly “model” a business so they can have a very clear picture of how businesses work.</description>

      <description>I had a whim and wanted to do some quick bibliometric analysis on the topic of “strategic positioning”.
The raw data is extracted from Web of Science. The search parameters:

      <description>Imagine you are invited to a party. Probably you want to get noticed by other partygoers. Or at least you want to be recognized as a cool person by those who you are interested in and care about. The “coolness” will result in some social benefits you desire. This scene is about “social evaluation,” which applies to both individuals and firms. On the social evaluation stage, because there are peer actors (competitors) joining you, you want to stand out of the crowd to impress your audiences (customers and suppliers).</description>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in {Strategy} @ University of California, Riverside.
 My research concerns the interplay between corporate strategy and the social structure of the market. For example, I study how mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) change a firm&#39;s identity in relation to its peers and the inter-firm network structure, triggering the stock market&#39;s reactions.</description>
