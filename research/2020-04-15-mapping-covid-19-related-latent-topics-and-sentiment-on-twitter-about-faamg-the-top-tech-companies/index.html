<h1>1 Motivation</h1>
<p>On a whim, I mapped out what people say (the text) and feel (the sentiment) about the top tech companies (FAAMG) on twitter since the Covid-19 outbreak. The keywords and sentiment that are associated with the main topics should differ across these companies.</p>
<p>By no means I am drawing any causal association here. But the story starts with checking the recent price movements of the FAAMG stocks. Obviously, Covid-19 has impacted these companies quite differently.</p>

<div id="data-source" class="section level2">
<h2>2.1 Data Source</h2>
<p>For each company, I downloaded 1,000 tweets containing the company name as the hashtag (e.g. “#amazon” for Amazon).
I used Python module “tweepy” to stream the data and set the “since” parameter to ‘2020-03-01’, which collects a sample of 1,000 tweets since March 1st.</p>
</div>
<div id="topic-modeling" class="section level2">
<h2>2.2 Topic Modeling</h2>
<p>Using Python module “gensim”, I detected three most significant topics (including Covid-19, business, and daily life), which are named by the associated keywords (most relevant terms).</p>
<p><img src="/opinion_mining/041520_FAAMG_twitter_topic_sentiment/lda.png" alt="latent topics and revevant terms"></p>
<p>Using Python module “vaderSentiment”, I computed sentiment scores for each tweet and aggregated the scores by company. The topic-based sentiment scores are used to construct the perceptual map, in which each company takes a different position.
Using Python module “nltk”, I find the most frequent topic-based co-occurring words for each company.</p>

<p><img src="/opinion_mining/041520_FAAMG_twitter_topic_sentiment/topic_sentiment_FAAMG.png" alt="perceptual map and the positioning of each company"></p>
<p>It looks Amazon does well on all topics, especially on Covid-19-related topic. Microsoft and Apple do well on “Business”.</p>
