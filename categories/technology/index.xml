      <description>Five days ago, the R package “reticulate”(1.11.1) was released on Cran, which allows us to directly call python objects in R1. Bloggers have been praising this ground-breaking development all the time for the enhanced interoperability between R and Python. Because with “reticulate,” we no longer need to jump between different IDEs in order to work on the same projects to leverage the complementarity between R and Python. This will certainly bring great change to the programming routine of many data scientists.</description>
